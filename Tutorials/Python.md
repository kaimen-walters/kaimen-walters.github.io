# Python

## What is Python?

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a high-level, object-oriented programming language used by many entry level programmers due to its easily readable syntax. It is comparable to Perl, Ruby, or Java. Its intuitive syntax makes programs easy to write and for others to more easily understand the code you have written. Other features of Python include its large standard library, platform compatibility, and price. Python is currently up to version 3.4.3 but Python 2.7.10 is still widely used.
